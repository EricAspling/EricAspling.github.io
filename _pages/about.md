I am a Ph.D. student at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/) studying relativistic quantum information and quantum information. Straight out of high school, I studied mathematics with an interest in number theory. Through a series of unfortunate events, I was unable to complete my degree at that time. After a few odd jobs, I landed as a cook and later a chef, working in various restaurants, one of which was Michelin-rated. Despite my success in the restaurant industry, I eventually decided I needed to return to school to finish my education. During the transitionary phase, I developed a keen interest in the physics of time and have been curious about this field since. For a more detailed (and personal) story, head over to my [Blog](https://ericaspling.com/blog/).

I am currently working to unite the fields of relativistic quantum information and quantum Shannon theory <p>the theory of quantum communication<p> through the usage of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Unruh-DeWitt detectors provide a unique framework for developing realizable quantum information propagation in quantum materials. Whether that be for quantum computing, scrambling/thermalization, or other entanglementand entropic processes. The development of Shannon theory in conformal field theories and theories of warped space-time will provide decades of future work. I am currently on the job market seeking my first post-doc position and will be completing my Ph.D. shortly under the supervision of [Michael Lawler](https://lawlergroup.lassp.cornell.edu/).

Along-side my technical research, I am passionate about science communication and am open to speaking engagements. Science communicators such as Brian Greene, Sean Carroll, Lenny Susskind, and others, inspired me through the darkest times in my life. During the pandemic, I started [Physics Office Hours](https://www.twitch.tv/physicsoh), a place where struggling undergrads, curious laymen, and science professionals could gather, learn, and teach physics casually and without judgement and elitism. While I no longer am able to contribute, I am happy to have hours and hours of VODs and notes for anyone to learn topics that some may find interesting. Head on over to my Science Communication tab to see more.
