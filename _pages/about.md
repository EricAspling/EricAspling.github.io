I recently earned my Ph.D. at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/) studying relativistic quantum information and quantum computing under the supervision of [Michael Lawler](https://lawlergroup.lassp.cornell.edu/). My project focused on quantum field mediated processes and Quantum Shannon theoretic applications to condensed matter systems. Utilizing an impurity form of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, I was able to introduce quantum circuitry with a basis in QFT to condensed matter protocols through the process of bosonization. In the formalism of continuous coherent states, I deleveloped noise models with dephasing-like protocols and a set of universal field-mediated quantum gates. 

I am currently employed as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Griffiss Institute at the Air Force Research Lab in Rome N.Y. My current interests include qubit-field interactions in superconducting quantum computing and circuit QED, heterogeneous quantum device networking, and long-range quantum transduction with emphasis on the nature of quantum fields. I currently maintain a collaboration with Binghamton and Cornell, elucidating quantum information protocols in doped monolayer [TMDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal_dichalcogenide_monolayers). My studies involving qubit-field interactions have left an insatiable urge for understanding the nature of time when introducing quantum circuits on a manifold. This includes problems such as post-selected closed time-like curves, information paradoxes, quantum thermodynamics, etc. 

I spent the entriety of my PhD. honing skills as an instructor and science communicator and became very passionate about these. Please browse the various pages in the cite for more details. Thanks.
